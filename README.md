# FACE-AND-EYE-DETECTION-SYSTEM
This repository contains a Python project for a simple Facial Detection Engine using pre-trained Haar classifiers. The project includes code for detecting faces and eyes using OpenCV, along with a graphical user interface built with tkinter. It requires Python 3 and an IDE like PyCharm, along with a webcam for real-time detection.
